Click on an order for more info about it, and use the tags for a quick guide on whether you will be able to complete the order. Orders that have been taken by someone will have a blue tag with the username of the person that took the order. If the order hasn't been taken it will have a blue 'NOT ASSIGNED' tag. To take an order post on the Sigton's Shop thread so that an order list updater can update the list of orders. Enjoy using the tool!",
